# gandisc
This is the repo for GAN for discrete data.

Test


gandiscrete_1.py, the data has 100k recs, use 90k to train the model, gan. Then use the trained gan to generate 10k fake data, and the rest 10k real data for comparison.


gandiscrete_2.py, same as gandiscrete_1.py, except for using 3 hidden layers for both G and D.
